/**
 * @title Governance Contract.
 * @notice This is an adapted clone of compoundâ€™s governance model. In general,
 * the process is the same: Token holders can make (executable) proposals if
 * they possess enough voting power, vote on proposals during a predefined
 * voting period and in the end evaluate the outcome. If successful, the
 * proposal will be scheduled on the timelock contract. Only after sufficient
 * time passed, it can be executed. A minimum voting power is required for
 * making a proposal as well as a minimum quorum.
 *
 * Voting power in the Bitocracy:
 * Stakers will receive voting power in the Bitocracy in return for their
 * staking commitment. This voting power is weighted by how much SOV is staked
 * and for how long the staking period is - staking more SOV over longer staking
 * periods results in higher voting power. With this voting power, users can
 * vote for or against any SIP in bitocracy.sovryn.app.
