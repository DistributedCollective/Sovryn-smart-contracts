/**
 * @title Loan Token Logic Standard contract.
 * @notice This contract code comes from bZx. bZx is a protocol for tokenized margin
 * trading and lending https://bzx.network similar to the dYdX protocol.
 *
 * Logic around loan tokens (iTokens) required to operate borrowing,
 * and margin trading financial processes.
 *
 * The user provides funds to the lending pool using the mint function and
 * withdraws funds from the lending pool using the burn function. Mint and
 * burn refer to minting and burning loan tokens. Loan tokens represent a
 * share of the pool and gather interest over time.
 *
 * Interest rates are determined by supply and demand. When a lender deposits
 * funds, the interest rates go down. When a trader borrows funds, the
 * interest rates go up. Fulcrum uses a simple linear interest rate formula
 * of the form y = mx + b. The interest rate starts at 1% when loans aren't
 * being utilized and scales up to 40% when all the funds in the loan pool
 * are being borrowed.
 *
 * The borrow rate is determined at the time of the loan and represents the
 * net contribution of each borrower. Each borrower's interest contribution
 * is determined by the utilization rate of the pool and is netted against
 * all prior borrows. This means that the total amount of interest flowing
 * into the lending pool is not directly changed by lenders entering or
 * exiting the pool. The entrance or exit of lenders only impacts how the
 * interest payments are split up.
 *
 * For example, if there are 2 lenders with equal holdings each earning
 * 5% APR, but one of the lenders leave, then the remaining lender will earn
 * 10% APR since the interest payments don't have to be split between two
 * individuals.
