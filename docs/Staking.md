**Staking**

Pay-in and pay-out function for staking and withdrawing tokens.
Staking is delegated and vested: To gain voting power, SOV holders must
stake their SOV for a given period of time. Aside from Bitocracy
participation, there's a financially-rewarding reason for staking SOV.
Tokenholders who stake their SOV receive staking rewards, a pro-rata share
of the revenue that the platform generates from various transaction fees
plus revenues from stakers who have a portion of their SOV slashed for
early unstaking.

> ### delegateBySig

Delegates votes from signatory to a delegatee account.
Voting with EIP-712 Signatures.
     * Voting power can be delegated to any address, and then can be used to
vote on proposals. A key benefit to users of by-signature functionality
is that they can create a signed vote transaction for free, and have a
trusted third-party spend rBTC(or ETH) on gas fees and write it to the
blockchain for them.
     * The third party in this scenario, submitting the SOV-holder’s signed
transaction holds a voting power that is for only a single proposal.
The signatory still holds the power to vote on their own behalf in
the proposal if the third party has not yet published the signed
transaction that was given to them.
