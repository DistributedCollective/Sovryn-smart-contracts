/**
 * @title Loan Token Base contract.
 * @notice This contract code comes from bZx. bZx is a protocol for tokenized margin
 * trading and lending https://bzx.network similar to the dYdX protocol.
 *
 * Specific loan related storage for iTokens.
 *
 * An loan token or iToken is a representation of a user funds in the pool and the
 * interest they've earned. The redemption value of iTokens continually increase
 * from the accretion of interest paid into the lending pool by borrowers. The user
 * can sell iTokens to exit its position. The user might potentially use them as
 * collateral wherever applicable.
 *
 * There are three main tokens in the bZx system, iTokens, pTokens, and BZRX tokens.
 * The bZx system of lending and borrowing depends on iTokens and pTokens, and when
 * users lend or borrow money on bZx, their crypto assets go into or come out of
 * global liquidity pools, which are pools of funds shared between many different
 * exchanges. When lenders supply funds into the global liquidity pools, they
 * automatically receive iTokens; When users borrow money to open margin trading
 * positions, they automatically receive pTokens. The system is also designed to
 * use the BZRX tokens, which are only used to pay fees on the network currently.
