 * @title Loan Token contract.
 * @notice This contract code comes from bZx. bZx is a protocol for tokenized
 * margin trading and lending https://bzx.network similar to the dYdX protocol.
 *
 * A loan token (iToken) is created as a proxy to an upgradable token contract.
 *
 * Examples of loan tokens on Sovryn are iRBTC, iDOC, iUSDT, iBPro,
 * iSOV (near future).
 *
 * Lenders receive iTokens that collect interest from the lending pool
 * which they can redeem by withdrawing them. The i in iToken stands for interest.
 *
 * Do not confuse iTokens with underlying tokens. iDOC is an iToken (loan token)
 * whilest DOC is the underlying token (currency).
 *
 * @dev TODO: can I change this proxy to EIP-1822 proxy standard, please.
 *   https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822. It's really hard to work with this.
