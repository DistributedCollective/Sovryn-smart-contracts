 * Bottlenecks found on first and second test, but unfortunately the flow diverges at some point
 * so it is required to walk through it again.
 *
 * Total time elapsed: 4.9s
 * After optimization: 4.7s
 *
 * Other minor optimizations:
 * - removed unneeded variables
 *
 * Notes: Applied fixture to save initial snapshot for all tests.
