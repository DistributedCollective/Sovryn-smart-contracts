/** Speed optimized on branch hardhatTestRefactor, 2021-10-01
 * Bottleneck found at beforeEach hook, redeploying tokens,
 *  protocol, ... on every test.
 *
 * Total time elapsed: 6.5s
 * After optimization: 5.3s
 *
 * Notes: Applied fixture to use snapshot beforeEach test.
 *   Moved some initialization code from tests to fixture.
 *
 *   Added tests to increase the test coverage index:
 *     + "Test deposit collateral sending Ether as collateral"
 *     + "should fail LoanMaintenance fallback"
 *     + Tests on the "Reducing Margin" slot.
