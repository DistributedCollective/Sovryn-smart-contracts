# HARDHAT WAY

**_HH is short for Hardhat_**

## **JSON-RPC**

Available JSON-RPC methods: [https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/#json-rpc-methods-support](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/#json-rpc-methods-support)

Most methods implemented in `tests-js/Utils/Ethereum.js`. Feel free to add missing relevant functions here.

In contrast with Truffle, there are no

```
evm_setTime, evm_freezeTime, miner_start, miner_stop
```

and some other methods which are mostly replaceable with the HH supported methods.

That may cause troubles with time-dependend tests when migrating to HH though. If this is the case then try to search in the tests-js dir for the pattern. Lookup the failing function that works in Truffle by its name.

The best approach to transform tests from Truffle to HH is to look for a relevant pattern in `tests-js/Governance` and other tests in `tests-js` dir.

There are commented legacy Truffle methods like `setTime(...)` deliberately left commented to facilitate search for patterns while transitioning from Truffle to HH.

## **ACCOUNTS PK**

Need to access test environment accounts Private Keys i.e. to test `ecrecover` or sign raw txs offchain? You got covered! Use [tests-js/Utils/hardhat_utils.js](Utils/hardhat_utils.js).

## **CONFIGS**

There are two HH configs: the main `hardhat.config.js` for running pure hh tests and the secondary `hardhat-ganache-tests.config.js` for the tests that can only be executed under ganache (with the hardhat-ganache plugin).

There is only one such a test for the moment where it is necessary to put two txs in one block which is not supported by HH so is forcedly run under ganache. HH team is working on an extended toolbelt that will include such an option.

If you have to run a test under ganache, just put `;with Ganache` in the end of the test title.

run

```
npm run-script test-js
```

to run all the test-js tests. See `package.json `section `scripts`.

## **BLOCKCHAIN INTERACTION**

`const { ethers } = require('hardhat');`

to get ethers.js library [extended with awsome functions](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-ethers.html).

`require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-web3");`

if you prefer [web3](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-web3.html)

> Using the listed HH plugins is the recommended approach to interact with the blockchain.
> I.e. [openzeppelin helpers](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-helpers/) produce incorrect results occasionally.
