/**
 * @title StakingStorageShared contract is inherited by Staking modules.
 * @notice Just the storage part of stacking contract, no functions,
 * only constant, variables and required structures (mappings).
 * Used by StackingProxy and Checkpoints contracts.
 *
 * What is SOV staking?
 * The purpose of the SOV token is to provide a pseudonymous,
 * censorship-resistant mechanism for governing the parameters of the Sovryn
 * protocol, while aligning the incentives of protocol governors with the
 * long-term success of the protocol. Any SOV token holder can choose to
 * stake (lock up) their tokens for a fixed period of time in return for
 * voting rights in the Bitocracy. Stakers are further incentivised through
 * fee and slashing rewards.
